Game Description:

Objective:
The player controls a spaceship that must navigate through a field of asteroids and other space obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with asteroids and shooting them to break them into smaller pieces.

Game Elements:
Spaceship: Controlled by the player, capable of moving in any direction and shooting bullets.
Asteroids: Large space rocks that move in random directions. When shot, they break into smaller asteroids.
Bullets: Fired by the spaceship to destroy asteroids.
Score System: Points are awarded for each asteroid destroyed.


Game Dynamics:
The asteroids move in different directions and speeds, posing a challenge for the player.
Shooting an asteroid splits it into smaller pieces, which may be more difficult to avoid.
The game gets progressively more challenging as the number and speed of asteroids increase.

Skills Learned and Developed:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Design and implement classes for Spaceship, Asteroid, Bullet, and other game entities.
Utilize concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to model the game elements.

Graphics and User Interface:
Use Java's graphics libraries (e.g., JavaFX and Swing) to create a visually appealing and interactive game window.
Implement user input handling for spaceship movement and shooting.

Collision Detection:
Learn how to detect collisions between different game entities, such as spaceships and asteroids or bullets and asteroids.

Game Loop:
Implement a game loop to handle continuous updates and rendering of the game state.

Randomization:
Use random number generation to create unpredictable movement patterns for asteroids.

Scoring System:
Design and implement a scoring system that rewards players for successfully destroying asteroids.

Game State Management:
Handle different game states (e.g., menu, playing, game over) and transitions between them.

Refactoring and Optimization:
Practice refactoring code for improved readability and efficiency.
Optimize performance to handle a larger number of game entities smoothly.
